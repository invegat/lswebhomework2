        <tspan x="0">Never in all their history have men been able to truly to conceive of the world as</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="15">one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="15">which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="15">every point, or none is center - an equal earth which all men occupy as equals.</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="15">The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice,</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="15">not in theory.</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="30">Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="15">evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warning about</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="15">technological dangers also come from science.</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="30">What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="15">the Moon but that they set eye on earth.</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="30">A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="15">beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. Thats how I feel seeing</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="15">the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="30">For those who have seen Earth from space, and for the hundreds and</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="15">perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="15">perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="15">those which divide us.</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="45" class="header">The Final Frontier</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="30">There can be no thought of finishing 'aiming for the stars.' Both figuratively</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="15">and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="15">progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</tspan>
        <tspan x="10" dy="45" class="quote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and reality of tomorrow.
            Science has
        </tspan>
        <tspan x="10" dy="15" class="quote">not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next yar and yet far
            too little for
        </tspan>
        <tspan x="10" dy="15" class="quote">the next 10.</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="30">Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not work of any one man or even a</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="15">group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="15">accordance with the natural laws of human development.</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="45" class="header">Reaching for the Stars</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="30">As we got farther and farther away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="15">shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="15">beautiful, warm, living object looked to fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it
        </tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="15">with a finger it would crumble and fall appart. Seeing this has to change a man.</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="700">Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="15">five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life, and new</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="15">civilizations, to boldly go where no man as gone before.</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="15">As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="15">there's a fundemental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is</tspan>
        <tspan x="0" dy="15">exploration at its greatest.</tspan>
