            </tspan>
            <tspan x="0" dy="13">one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in

            <tspan x="0" dy="13">which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because</tspan>

            <tspan x="0" dy="13">beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. Thats how I feel seeing
            </tspan>

            <tspan x="0" dy="13">perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your</tspan>
            <tspan x="0" dy="13">perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than</tspan>
